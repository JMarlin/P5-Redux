SUB_0x3CA9 : (specific to AX = 0x0013)
vgabios.c symbol: biosfn_set_video_mode
---------------------------------------
- Restore AL from the stack (bp style), then place it directly after the stack
- Jump the stack pointer 16 bytes (8 places) forward
- Call SUB_0x987E
[SUB_0x987E executes]
- Test the AX value passed back from SUB_0x987E to see if it's zero
 - If (it's not zero):
    - 0xC3CBF: clear AX and push it onto the stack
    - Call SUB_0xC964B
    [SUB_0xC964B executes]
    - Rewind the stack pointer by a position
- Restore AL from the stack (bp style, same data as step 1)
- Move AL AND 0x7F back to the same spot in the stack
- Restore AL from the same spot again
- Clear AH
- Push AX (now 00al & 0x007F) onto the end of the stack
  NOTE: What with the rewinding of the pointer, this overwrites the
  AX value we had pushed to the stack in step 1
  ADDED NOTE: Which makes sense, because that stack location appears
  to be the mode variable in vgabios.c
- Call SUB_7D4E
[SUB_7D4E runs]
