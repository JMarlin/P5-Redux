SUB_7D4E (specific to ax = 0013)
vgabios.c symbol: find_vga_entry
---------------------------------
-push bp and then set it to the current sp
-move the sp one position beyond the stack (eg: subtract 2)
-move 0xFF into al and then use bp to place al at the lo half of new stack location
-clear al and put it in the hi half of that stack position
-0xC7D5D jump to 0xC7D82
-0xC7D82: use bp to put the hi half of the same stack position back into al
 -If (al <= 0x0F) then jump to 0xC7D5F (<=MODE_MAX)
   -0xC7D5F: use bp to put the hi half of the stack al back into al
   -clear ah
   -set cl to 3 and shift ax left cl{3} places (I assume to compensate for 
    the size of the struct)
   -al = 0xC000:[ax+0x214] (vga_modes[i].svgamode)
   -compare al with the bp:stack ax (mode variable)
   -if they don't match, jump to 0xC7D7B
   -0xC7D7B: restore the hi half of the bp stack position into al (i)
   -increase it
   -return it to stack memory
   -restore it from stack memory to al
   -If (al <= 0x0f) go back to 0xC7D5F
 -Else
